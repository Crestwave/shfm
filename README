wip file manager written in posix shell

note: likely very broken


features
________________________________________________________________________________

* draws in the most inefficient fashion possible. whole screen updates every key
  press. language choice limits us GREATLY here (no arrays).

* really nice escape sequence handling for keys which emit '\033[<stuff>'. Not
  based on read timeouts. Based on tracking position within sequences.

* has no dependencies other than a POSIX shell and POSIX coreutils (for printf,
  [, etc if not builtin).

- [ ] opener
- [ ] resize (POSIX shell winch is not asynchronous during read + SIGWINCH?)
