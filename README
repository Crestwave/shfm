shfm [wip]
________________________________________________________________________________

wip file manager written in posix shell

note: likely very broken


features
________________________________________________________________________________

* really nice escape sequence handling for keys which emit '\033[<stuff>'. Not
  based on read timeouts. Based on tracking position within sequences.

* has no dependencies other than a POSIX shell and POSIX coreutils (for printf,
  [, etc if not builtin).

* movement uses vim-like keybinds (hjkl).
